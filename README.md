# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of Project
The PlanMyTrip application was created to help travelers plan the ultimate trip for them based on their personal preferences.  This project
was completed to create some changes to the app to make it even better. Users are able to enter their weather preferences which are then used to identify
potential travel destinations and hotels nearby.  The beta tester will choose four cities, and a travel itinerary will be created.  We also used Google Maps Directions API to create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
